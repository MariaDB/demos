Prompting:
'Can MariaDB be used instead of an Oracle database?'

    LLM response with RAG:'
    Yes, MariaDB can be used instead of an Oracle database, particularly for organizations looking to migrate from Oracle while preserving SQL syntax and behavior. From MariaDB 10.3 onward, setting `SQL_MODE=ORACLE` allows for compatibility with Oracle Database SQL syntax and behavior, which can ease the transition for existing applications and queries. Though there may be some differences in features and capabilities, many functionalities can be retained or adapted.

For more information about using Oracle compatibility mode in MariaDB, you can refer to the following documentation: [SQL_MODE=ORACLE](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/sql-modeoracle/).'
    

    LLM response without RAG:
    'Yes, MariaDB can be used as an alternative to Oracle Database in many scenarios. Both are relational database management systems (RDBMS), but there are some differences in features, licensing, performance, and compatibility. MariaDB is open-source and tends to be cost-effective, while Oracle Database provides extensive enterprise features and support.

When considering switching from Oracle to MariaDB, it's essential to evaluate your specific requirements, such as scalability, performance, compliance, and the need for certain Oracle features that may not be present in MariaDB.

For a more detailed comparison and guidance, you can refer to the official MariaDB documentation or resources that discuss migration paths and compatibility.
